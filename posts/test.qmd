# Introduction

Let's start with a glorious mosquito pic from Wikipedia

![Mosquito from Wikipedia](../img/repro.jpeg){#fig-mosquito}

## What is it about ?

This is just to check the possibilities in pages. The goal is to talk about math of course, but also historical and biological aspects. I need to write math(see @eq-jumpSDE), but also code (see @lst-world) and include images (see @fig-mosquito).

For instance, a beautiful integral using Point measure:
$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\int_{\mathbb{R_+}} \mathbb{1}_{\lambda(x)\leq \theta} \, dN(\theta,x) = 1
$${#eq-jumpSDE}

And a little bit of python code, just to check if it can work:
```{python}
#| lst-label: lst-world
#| lst-cap: can the world see me ?

print("hello world")
```

The code is working, thx Julian !
