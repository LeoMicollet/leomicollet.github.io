## My PhD
* **Subject:** Stochastic and deterministic modeling of insect population control by sterile males releasing - Applications in agro-ecology and epidemiology.

* Started on October 2024.

* **Supervisors:** [Camille Coron](https://camillecoron.github.io/) and [Luis Almeida](https://www.ljll.fr/~almeida/).

## Research Interests
My research focuses on the control of a given population using Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) or Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) using stochastic models.

My work aims to understand the dynamics of these populations, with properties such as extinction, reemergence, and the impact of environmental covariables on the population dynamics.

I study stochastic tools such as branching processes, birth-death processes and their limiting behavior, such as deterministic systems and stochastic diffusion models. Specifically, I focus on the *Aedes* genus, using real data from the Tetiaroa atoll.
