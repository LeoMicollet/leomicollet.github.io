# My PhD
* **Subject:** Stochastic and deterministic modeling of insect population control by sterile males releasing - Applications in agro-ecology and epidemiology.

* Started on October 2024.

* **Supervisors:** [Camille Coron](https://camillecoron.github.io/) and [Luis Almeida](https://www.ljll.fr/~almeida/).

## Research interests

I aim to understand the dynamics of mosquito populations, with properties such as extinction, reemergence, and the impact of environmental factors on the population dynamics. Specifically, I focus on the *Aedes* genus, using real-world data.

I use mathematical tools such as branching processes, stochastic compartmental models and their limiting behavior, such as deterministic systems and stochastic diffusion.
